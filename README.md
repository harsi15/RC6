#RC6 Encryption Algorithm
RC6 is a symmetric key block encryption algorithm designed to provide highly secure encryption of a block of data. It was created by Ronald Rivest in 1997 as an improvement over RC5, providing better security and performance.

#Description
RC6 operates on data blocks of size 32, 64, or 128 bits, using a variable-sized key of up to 2040 bits. The algorithm employs a combination of modular addition, bitwise XOR, and left rotations to perform its encryption and decryption operations. RC6 uses a specified number of rounds for encryption, with each round iterating over the data blocks to create the encrypted output.

#Java Implementation
I have implemented the RC6 encryption algorithm in Java to provide a secure and efficient encryption solution. The implementation includes methods for encrypting and decrypting data using RC6, as well as functions for key generation and management. The Java implementation ensures the integrity and confidentiality of the encrypted data, making it suitable for a wide range of secure communication and data protection applications.
